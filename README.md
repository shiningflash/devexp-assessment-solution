# Developer Experience Assessment

Welcome to this assessment!

You will find below the instructions to complete for your work assessment:  you will have to develop a Python library that interacts with a ReST API, keeping in mind to offer a great developer experience to whoever uses it.

## Understanding the API

You can find the OpenAPI Specification for this API in YAML at the following location: [./docs/openapi.yaml](./docs/openapi.yaml)

Typically, such YAML file is not meant to be read by an API user but rather to be processed by a specification viewer such as SwaggerUI or Redocly. You're in luck, we have prepared both tools for you!

### Browsing the API

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the root of the cloned repository on your local machine
3. If not yet installed, install Docker on your machine
4. Execute the command `docker compose up`
5. (If instructed, run the command `docker compose pull` to fetch the latest version of the Docker image)

This command will start 3 servers locally:
 - http://localhost:8080 => Swagger UI
 - http://localhost:8090 => Redocly
 - http://localhost:3000 => the API server, using a local database

Up to you to choose which UI to use to browse the API.

### API explanations

The API is a very simple messaging API where a user can:
 - manage contacts (`create`, `update`, `get`, `list` and `delete`)
 - `send` a message to a contact (this is just a simulation, no real message will be sent)
 - `get` details about a sent message, `list` all the sent messages

### Authentication

All the endpoints are protected by an API Key: `there-is-no-key` üêá

When sending a message to the API, all requests must contain the following header: `Authorization: Bearer there-is-no-key`

## Your tasks

### Implement a SDK in Python

With the developer experience in mind, create a Python library that can be used to interact with the API. With this library:
 - a user should not care about specifying the authentication header for every requests
 - a user should be able to ‚Äúauto-discover‚Äù the API parameters thanks to the auto-completion in the IDE
 - a user should be able to use all the API methods without having to know their path or their HTTP method

### Test your SDK

Make sure to include some tests in your submission! We would love to discuss with you how you make sure your code is working.

## Bonus tasks

You may have noticed that when you send a message, the status is set to `queued` but after a while, the status becomes `failed`. This API simulates a sending queue and will consider that the message is properly delivered if there is a server that acknowledges the delivery.

In order to do so, you will need to use the last section of the API: the webhooks. When you send a message, the API server will send a request to a WEBHOOK_URL(default http://localhost:3010/webhooks) and include an `Authorization` header with the message signature (signed by default with the WEBHOOK_SECRET `mySecret`).
Here is the signature algorithm in pseudo-code:
```
function generateSignature(message, secret):
    # Step 1: Create an HMAC object with SHA256 as the hashing algorithm
    hmac = createHMAC(secret, "sha256")
    
    # Step 2: Update the HMAC object with the message
    hmac.update(message)
    
    # Step 3: Compute the final HMAC digest and return it as a hexadecimal string
    signature = hmac.digest("hex")
    
    return signature
```

You will have to:
 - implement an application server that will receive the events notifications
 - add a method in your SDK to verify that the `Authorization` header is valid
 - in your application server, use your SDK library to validate the `Authorization` header and handle the event (Printing the body in the console will be enough)

## Submission

All your code has to be pushed to a public GitHub repository. When you are done, share it with your recruiter, we will review your submission and discuss it with you in your next interview. Good luck!
